# QWEN.md â€“ Project Context for LowCal-dev

This file provides instructional context for future interactions with the LowCal-dev repository. It is generated from an analysis of the repository structure, key files, and documentation present in the project. It aims to guide how the AI should approach tasks related to this codebase.

## Project Overview (Code Project)

LowCal-dev hosts the Qwen Code ecosystem, a CLI and core server for AI-assisted developer workflows. The repository is organized as a TypeScript/Node.js workspace with multiple packages:

- packages/cli: Command-line interface for interacting with Qwen Code
- packages/core: Core backend and tooling registry
- bundle/: Built distributable and entry point gemini.js
- docs/: Documentation site and markdown sources
- integration-tests/: End-to-end test suites
- scripts/: Build and release helpers

Key characteristics:
- Language: TypeScript
- Runtime: Node.js (>= 20)
- Build system: npm workspaces
- Testing: Vitest
- Linting: ESLint + Prettier

## Building and Running

- Install dependencies: npm ci
- Build all packages: npm run build:all
- Run the CLI in development: npm run start
- Run tests: npm run test --workspaces
- Preflight (format + lint + build + typecheck + tests): npm run preflight

Notes:
- The repo root runs a workspace with multiple packages. Individual package.json files control per-package behavior.
- The main binary is bundle/gemini.js exposed as qwen via package.json bin field.

## Development Conventions

- Code style: ESLint + Prettier; strict TypeScript; adhere to existing conventions across packages.
- Testing: Vitest-based tests across packages; ensure unit and integration tests pass.
- Commits: Use conventional commits; changelog is generated by scripts.
- Building: Use root Makefile wrappers; per-package build scripts exist under scripts/build.js and package.json definitions.

## How to Use This File (Memory & Context)

- QWEN.md is loaded hierarchically as context for the AI. It can be loaded from various locations such as global (~/.qwen/QWEN.md) and project-specific QWEN.md. See memory components in docs.
- The memory system concatenates content from multiple QWEN.md sources, providing hierarchy-based guidance to the model during tool use.

## Context File Hierarchy and Loading

- Global QWEN.md: ~/.qwen/QWEN.md
- Project/Ancestor QWEN.md: located in project roots and ancestor directories that contain context files
- Sub-directory QWEN.md: within nested directories for component-specific context

Content is merged with separators to indicate origin. The UI displays the loaded context count in the footer.

## Tools and Core Concepts

- read_file, write_file, list_directory, glob, search_file_content, edit, web_fetch, web_search, save_memory are core tools.
- The core orchestrates model calls, tool usage, and memory management.
- Slot-based subagents provide specialized tasks via /agents commands.

## Development Plan (High-Level)
1. Inspect repository for a plan to generate QWEN.md and ensure alignment with current structure.
2. Compile a comprehensive QWEN.md that documents: project overview, building/running steps, conventions, and context-loading behavior.
3. Save the content to QWEN.md and verify formatting.
4. Outline follow-up steps for verification (lint/build/test) if requested.

## Change Log (Provenance)
- Generated by interactive planning for LowCal-dev context generation.
