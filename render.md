## User Message

Examine the codebase and provide a detailed explanation of how react and ink render the elements of the conversation, including tables, code blocks, lists, boxes, etc. I want to know why sometimes a table will include truncated lines of text with ... which makes them unable to read the full intended text. Then explain how the /export command translates the cli markdown display into the markdown files it creates. /export doesn't seem to exactly replicate the visuals from the cli and I'm wondering why.

**How the UI is built**

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Message flow**
   - The core UI lives in `packages/cli/src/ui`.
   - Every interaction creates a _history item_ (`type: 'user' | 'gemini' | …`) that is stored by `context.ui.addItem`.
   - The main renderer (`App.tsx` → `ConversationDisplay.tsx`) maps those items to React components such as `UserMessage`, `GeminiMessage`, `InfoMessage`, etc.

---

## Assistant Response

2. **Ink rendering**
   - All UI components use Ink primitives – `<Box>` for layout and `<Text>` for styled text.
   - Ink translates the React tree into terminal escape sequences, so the output you see is pure ANSI‑styled text.

---

## Assistant Response

3. **Markdown → Ink** (`InlineMarkdownRenderer.tsx`)

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
export const RenderInline = ({ text }) => {
  // parses markdown (code fences, bold/italic, links, etc.)
  // and returns a tree of <Text> elements with the appropriate colors/styles.
};
```

- Code blocks become `<Box marginX={2}>` + `<Text>` with a background colour.
- Lists are rendered by prefixing each line with “•”, “1.”, “-” etc., again using `<Text>`.
- Boxes (e.g. dialogs) are just nested `<Box borderStyle="round">` wrappers.

4. **Tables** (`TableRenderer.tsx`)

---

## Assistant Response

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
const columnWidths = headers.map((h, i) => {
  const headerWidth = getPlainTextLength(h);
  const maxRowWidth = Math.max(
    ...rows.map((r) => getPlainTextLength(r[i] || "")),
  );
  return Math.max(headerWidth, maxRowWidth) + 2; // padding
});
```

- `getPlainTextLength` strips markdown and counts visible characters (ignores ANSI codes).
- If the summed width exceeds the terminal (`terminalWidth`) a **scaleFactor** shrinks every column proportionally.

---

## Assistant Response

**Truncation logic**

---

## Assistant Response

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
if (displayWidth > contentWidth) {
  // < 4 chars → simple slice
  // otherwise binary‑search the longest prefix whose plain‑text length fits,
  // then append "..."
}
```

- The binary search stops when `candidateWidth <= contentWidth - 3`.
- Because truncation happens **after** markdown is rendered, any inline formatting (e.g. backticks, links) is lost in the truncated part – you only see the leading characters followed by “…”.

---

## Assistant Response

This explains why a table cell may appear as:

---

## Assistant Response

---

## Assistant Response

```
   │ long tex… │
```

---

## Assistant Response

The original markdown string still contains the full text; it’s just not displayed because the renderer had to fit the whole table into the current terminal width.

## Assistant Response

**How `/export` works**

---

## Assistant Response

File: `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/exportCommand.ts`

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
action: async (context, args) => {
  const historyItems = context.ui.loadHistory(); // raw items stored by UI
  let fileName = args.trim() ? sanitize(args) : "conversation.md";

  let markdownContent = `# Conversation Export\n\n`;
  markdownContent += `Exported on: ${new Date().toISOString()}\n\n`;

  for (const item of historyItems) {
    switch (item.type) {
      case "user":
        markdownContent += `## User\n\n${item.text}\n\n---\n\n`;
        break;
      case "gemini":
      case "gemini_content":
        markdownContent += `## Assistant\n\n${item.text}\n\n---\n\n`;
        break;
      case "info":
        markdownContent += `> ${item.text}\n\n`;
        break;
      case "error":
        markdownContent += `**Error:** ${item.text}\n\n`;
        break;
    }
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(fileName, markdownContent);
  context.ui.addItem(
    { type: "info", text: `Conversation exported to ${fileName}` },
    Date.now(),
  );
};
```

---

## Assistant Response

- **What gets written** – The command iterates over the _raw_ `item.text` strings that were originally fed into the UI. It does **not** run them through any Ink renderer; it simply concatenates them as plain markdown.

---

## Assistant Response

- **Why visual details differ**
  - **Tables:** In the UI a table is rendered by `TableRenderer`, which may have truncated cells to fit the terminal. The _original_ markdown string stored in `item.text` still contains the full cell content, but because the export command never invokes `TableRenderer`, it writes the raw markdown (e.g. `| long text that exceeds width |`). When you open the exported file in a normal editor you’ll see the full text, but if you view it with a terminal‑only renderer that applies the same truncation logic you’ll get the same “…” effect.
  - **Boxes / borders:** Ink’s `<Box borderStyle="round">` and similar decorations are purely visual – they are not part of the markdown payload. Consequently the exported file contains only the inner text (e.g., a dialog’s message) without the surrounding ASCII/Unicode box characters.
  - **Code blocks & lists:** These are preserved because they exist as markdown syntax (`\`\`\``, `- item`). The export command copies them verbatim, so they appear correctly in any markdown viewer.

---

## Assistant Response

- **Current limitation** – The command cannot access the _rendered_ layout (column widths, truncated strings) because that information lives only inside the Ink components at render time. Therefore the exported markdown may look different from what you saw on screen, especially for tables that were forced to shrink.

### TL;DR

## Assistant Response

| Feature                              | Rendered in terminal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Exported markdown |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Plain text / code blocks / lists** | Ink `<Text>` (styled) → same markdown is written out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Tables**                           | `TableRenderer` computes column widths, scales, and _truncates_ cells with “…”. Export writes the original markdown; no scaling/truncation occurs, so you either see the full cell content or, if you view the file with a terminal‑only table renderer, you’ll get the same truncation. |
| **Boxes / borders**                  | Ink `<Box borderStyle>` – visual only. Not stored in markdown → not present in export.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### How to make `/export` match the on‑screen view

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Capture rendered output** – Instead of using `item.text`, ask the UI layer for a _rendered string_ (e.g., call a helper that runs `TableRenderer` with a very wide virtual terminal width).
2. **Disable truncation for export** – Pass a large `terminalWidth` to `TableRenderer` (or expose a “no‑truncate” mode) so the full markdown is emitted.
3. **Add box decorations manually** – If you want the exported file to contain the same ASCII borders, generate them in the export routine (e.g., reuse the border strings from `TableRenderer`).

---

## Assistant Response

Implementing any of those steps would bring the exported `.md` files much closer to what you see inside the Qwen Code CLI.
