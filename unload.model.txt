I've investigated the code and can now provide a detailed explanation of how the /model command unloads the currently loaded model in LM Studio before loading a new one.

The process doesn't involve an explicit "unload" command. Instead, the tool implicitly unloads the model by re-initializing the chat with a new configuration. Here's a step-by-step 
breakdown of the process and the relevant code:

1. Config.setModel() is Called

When you select a new model from the dialog triggered by the /model command, the setModel method in the Config class is called. This method is located in 
packages/core/src/config/config.ts.

Its primary responsibilities are:

1. Updating the contentGeneratorConfig with the new model ID.
2. Calling geminiClient.reinitialize() to apply the new configuration.

Here is the setModel method:

1 // from /home/atmandk/qwen-local/packages/core/src/config/config.ts
2 
3   setModel(newModel: string): void {
4     if (this.contentGeneratorConfig) {
5       this.contentGeneratorConfig.model = newModel;
6     }
7 
8     // Reinitialize chat with updated configuration while preserving history
9     const geminiClient = this.getGeminiClient();
10     if (geminiClient && geminiClient.isInitialized()) {
11       // Use async operation but don't await to avoid blocking
12       geminiClient.reinitialize().catch((error) => {
13         console.error(
14           'Failed to reinitialize chat with updated config:',
15           error,
16         );
17       });
18     }
19   }

2. GeminiClient.reinitialize() Re-Initializes the Chat

The reinitialize method in the GeminiClient class (located in packages/core/src/core/client.ts) is responsible for orchestrating the model switch. It does this by:

1. Preserving the existing chat history.
2. Calling this.initialize() with the updated configuration, which includes the new model.

Here is the reinitialize method:

1 // from /home/atmandk/qwen-local/packages/core/src/core/client.ts
2 
3   async reinitialize(): Promise<void> {
4     if (!this.chat) {
5       return;
6     }
7 
8     // Preserve the current chat history (excluding environment context)
9     const currentHistory = this.getHistory();
10     // Remove the initial environment context (first 2 messages: user env + model acknowledgment)
11     const userHistory = currentHistory.slice(2);
12 
13     // Get current content generator config and reinitialize with preserved history
14     const contentGeneratorConfig = this.config.getContentGeneratorConfig();
15     if (contentGeneratorConfig) {
16       await this.initialize(contentGeneratorConfig, userHistory);
17     }
18   }

3. GeminiClient.initialize() Creates New Instances

The initialize method in GeminiClient is where the "unloading" and "loading" actually happens. It:

1. Creates a new ContentGenerator instance by calling createContentGenerator(). This new instance is configured with the new model.
2. Creates a new GeminiChat instance by calling this.startChat(). This new chat instance uses the new ContentGenerator.

The old ContentGenerator and GeminiChat objects, which were connected to the previous model, are discarded and eventually garbage-collected. This process of creating new instances 
effectively unloads the old model and loads the new one without an explicit "unload" command.

Here is the initialize method:

1 // from /home/atmandk/qwen-local/packages/core/src/core/client.ts
2 
3   async initialize(
4     contentGeneratorConfig: ContentGeneratorConfig,
5     extraHistory?: Content[],
6   ) {
7     this.contentGenerator = await createContentGenerator(
8       contentGeneratorConfig,
9       this.config,
10       this.config.getSessionId(),
11     );
12     /**
13      * Always take the model from contentGeneratorConfig to initialize,
14      * despite the `this.config.contentGeneratorConfig` is not updated yet because in
15      * `Config` it will not be updated until the initialization is successful.
16      */
17     this.chat = await this.startChat(
18       extraHistory || [],
19       contentGeneratorConfig.model,
20     );
21   }

In summary, the tool unloads the old model by replacing the objects that manage the connection to the model with new instances configured for the newly selected model.
