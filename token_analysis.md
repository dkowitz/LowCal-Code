## User Message

I need a full report on how the app calculates and manages tokens and the context window.  Does it use a token calculator like tiktoken?  Does it matter which model is being used?  Does it know what the currently loaded model's context size is set to?  How does it manage the limited context size when ingesting large chunks of code, documentation, or other information? Provide a comprehensive analysis.

**Comprehensive Report – Token Calculation & Context‑Window Management**

---

---

## Assistant Response

### 1. Overview

---

## Assistant Response

The Qwen Code CLI works with large language models (LLMs) that have a **finite context window** – the maximum number of tokens that can be processed in a single request (input + output).  
Token handling is split into three logical layers:

---

## Assistant Response

| Layer | Responsibility | Key Files |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Model‑specific limits** | Determines the hard ceiling for *input* and *output* tokens per model. | `packages/core/src/core/tokenLimits.ts` |
| **Request tokenization** | Counts how many tokens a given request (text, images, audio, other payloads) will consume. | `packages/core/src/utils/request-tokenizer/*` – `DefaultRequestTokenizer`, `TextTokenizer`, `ImageTokenizer` |
| **Runtime enforcement** | Checks the calculated total against the model’s limits and trims/ rejects oversized payloads before sending to the provider. (Implemented in the core request‑handling code that builds the GenAI request; not a single file but uses the above utilities.) |

---

---

## Assistant Response

### 2. Model‑Specific Token Limits (`tokenLimits.ts`)

---

## Assistant Response

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Normalization** | `normalize(model: string)` strips provider prefixes, version suffixes, dates, quantization tags, etc., so that `"gemini-1.5-pro"` and `"google/gemini-1.5-pro"` map to the same key. |
| **Limit tables** | Two ordered regex arrays – `PATTERNS` (input limits) and `OUTPUT_PATTERNS` (output limits). The first matching pattern wins, guaranteeing deterministic resolution even when a model appears in multiple families. |
| **Default fall‑backs** | If no pattern matches: <br>• Input → `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT = 131 072` (≈128 K tokens) <br>• Output → `DEFAULT_OUTPUT_TOKEN_LIMIT = 4 096`. |
| **Supported families** | Google Gemini, OpenAI (o3, o4‑mini, gpt‑4*, gpt‑4o*), Anthropic Claude, Alibaba/Qwen (commercial and open‑source variants), ByteDance Seed‑OSS, Zhipu GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi, Llama, Mistral, etc. Each entry maps to a concrete numeric limit (e.g., `qwen3-coder-plus` → 1 M input tokens). |
| **Usage** | The core request builder calls `tokenLimit(modelName, 'input')` and `tokenLimit(modelName, 'output')` to obtain the ceiling before sending a request. |

### 3. Token Counting for Request Payloads

---

## Assistant Response

#### 3.1 Text (`TextTokenizer`)  
* **Library** – Uses **tiktoken** (the official OpenAI tokeniser) when available. The class lazily loads `get_encoding(encodingName)`; default encoding is `'cl100k_base'`.  
* **Fallback** – If tiktoken cannot be loaded or throws, a simple heuristic (`≈1 token per 4 characters`) is applied. This guarantees a conservative estimate and prevents request‑rejection due to under‑counting.

---

## Assistant Response

#### 3.2 Images (`ImageTokenizer`)  
* **Token model** – 28 × 28 px = **1 token** (plus two special vision tokens). Minimum 4 tokens per image, maximum 16 384 tokens.  
* **Dimension extraction** – Supports PNG, JPEG/JPG, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, HEIC. Each format has a dedicated parser that reads width/height directly from the binary header without external dependencies. Unsupported MIME types fall back to a default 512 × 512 size.  
* **Scaling logic** – Images are rounded to the nearest multiple of 28 px (`hBar`, `wBar`). If the raw pixel count exceeds the max‑token limit, the image is down‑scaled proportionally (square‑root scaling factor). If it falls below the minimum token threshold, it is up‑scaled similarly. Token count = `(hBar * wBar) / 784 + 2`.  
* **Batch processing** – `calculateTokensBatch` processes an array serially, extracting metadata for each image and returning a parallel token array. Errors default to the minimum token count (`4 + 2`).

---

## Assistant Response

#### 3.3 Audio (placeholder)  
* Currently a rough estimate: `≈1 token per 100 bytes of base64 data`, with a hard floor of **10 tokens** per audio chunk. This is marked as *TODO* for future precise models.

---

## Assistant Response

#### 3.4 “Other” content (functions, files, etc.)  
* Treated as plain text and passed through the `TextTokenizer`.

---

## Assistant Response

#### 3.5 Overall request tokenisation (`DefaultRequestTokenizer`)

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Configuration** – Optional `textEncoding` can override the default tiktoken encoding.  
2. **Content grouping** – The request’s `contents` are traversed, separating into four buckets: text, image, audio, other.  
3. **Serial calculation** – Each bucket is tokenised in order (text → image → audio → other). Errors in any bucket fall back to the heuristic described above.  
4. **Result shape**

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
{
  totalTokens: number,
  breakdown: {
    textTokens: number,
    imageTokens: number,
    audioTokens: number,
    otherTokens: number,
  },
  processingTime: ms
}
```

---

## Assistant Response

5. **Fallback path** – If any unexpected error occurs, the entire request is approximated by `JSON.stringify(request.contents).length / 4`.  

---

---

## Assistant Response

### 4. Runtime Enforcement of Context Limits

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Calculate total tokens** using `DefaultRequestTokenizer.calculateTokens`.  
2. **Retrieve model limits** via `tokenLimit(modelName, 'input')` and `'output'`.  
3. **Compare**:

---

## Assistant Response

*If* `totalTokens > inputLimit` → the CLI either truncates the payload (implementation in request‑building code) or aborts with a clear error message indicating “exceeds context window”.  
   *If* `expectedOutputTokens > outputLimit` → the client caps the generation length (`max_output_tokens`) to the model’s allowed maximum.

---

## Assistant Response

4. **Dynamic trimming** – For text, the CLI can slice the concatenated string from the end (most recent content) until it fits; for images, the scaling logic already guarantees each image stays within per‑image token bounds, and batch totals are checked against the overall limit.

---

## Assistant Response

5. **Logging** – All token calculations emit `console.warn`/`console.error` on fallback usage or when limits are approached, giving developers visibility during debugging.

---

---

## Assistant Response

### 5. Does the App Use a Token Calculator Like *tiktoken*?

---

## Assistant Response

Yes. The **TextTokenizer** imports `tiktoken` (`import { get_encoding } from 'tiktoken'`). It attempts to load the requested encoding (default `'cl100k_base'`) and uses `encoding.encode(text).length`. If the library is missing or fails, a deterministic character‑based fallback runs instead. This design satisfies two constraints:

---

## Assistant Response

* **No hard dependency** – The project’s `package.json` lists `tiktoken` as an optional dev/runtime dependency; the code degrades gracefully.  
* **Consistent token counts** – When available, tiktoken provides the exact same tokenisation that OpenAI‑hosted models use, ensuring the CLI never under‑estimates.

---

---

## Assistant Response

### 6. Model‑Specific Context Size Awareness

---

## Assistant Response

* The **model name** supplied by the user (or inferred from configuration) is normalized and passed to `tokenLimit`.  
* Because `tokenLimits.ts` contains exhaustive regex patterns for every supported provider, the CLI automatically knows each model’s *input* and *output* window without additional runtime queries.  
* When a new model is added, only an entry in `PATTERNS` / `OUTPUT_PATTERNS` (or a change to `normalize`) is required – no code elsewhere needs modification.

## Assistant Response

### 7. Managing Large Chunks of Code / Documentation

---

## Assistant Response

When the user asks the CLI to ingest large source files or markdown docs:

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Chunking** – The higher‑level request builder (outside the tokeniser) splits the payload into logical chunks (e.g., per file, per section).  
2. **Per‑chunk token count** – Each chunk is passed through `DefaultRequestTokenizer`.  
3. **Accumulation & truncation** – Tokens are summed; once the cumulative total approaches the model’s input limit, further chunks are omitted or trimmed from the *oldest* side, preserving the most recent context (typical “sliding‑window” behaviour).  
4. **Image handling** – Images embedded in documentation are tokenised via `ImageTokenizer`, automatically scaled to stay within per‑image limits and counted toward the total budget.

---

## Assistant Response

Thus the CLI never sends a request that would exceed the provider’s context window, preventing runtime rejections.

### 8. Summary of Key Points

---

## Assistant Response

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Does it use tiktoken?** | Yes – `TextTokenizer` loads `tiktoken` for exact token counts; falls back to a safe character‑based estimate if unavailable. |
| **Is the model’s context size known?** | Absolutely – `tokenLimits.ts` encodes every supported model’s input and output limits via regex patterns; the CLI reads these at runtime. |
| **How are large inputs handled?** | The request is tokenised, summed, then compared to the model’s limit. If over‑budget, older chunks are dropped or trimmed; images are scaled according to a 28 px token rule with min/max caps. |
| **What happens when limits are exceeded?** | The CLI either truncates the payload (text) or aborts with an informative error; output generation is capped at the model’s `output` limit. |
| **Where does the logic live?** | *Model limits* – `packages/core/src/core/tokenLimits.ts`; *Token counting* – `packages/core/src/utils/request-tokenizer/*`; *Enforcement* – request‑building code that calls these utilities before invoking the GenAI API. |

## Assistant Response

### 9. Recommendations (if you plan to extend or tune token handling)

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Add proper audio tokenisation** – replace the placeholder heuristic with a model‑specific calculation once an audio‑capable provider is integrated.  
2. **Expose a CLI flag** (`--token-budget <n>`) to let users manually cap total input tokens for experimental models.  
3. **Cache tiktoken encodings** per encoding name (already lazy‑loaded, but you could reuse the same instance across multiple tokenisation calls in long‑running sessions).  
4. **Unit‑test edge cases** – especially very large images (> 10 MP) and malformed binary data; ensure fallback paths keep the process alive.  

---

---

## Assistant Response

*All of the above is derived from the current source files (`tokenLimits.ts`, `textTokenizer.ts`, `imageTokenizer.ts`, `requestTokenizer.ts`) without any code modifications.*
