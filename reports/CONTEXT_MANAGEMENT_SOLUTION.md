# Context Management & Self-Healing Solution

## Problem Statement

The application was experiencing "Unable to compress history to fit within the context window" errors, particularly when tools like `search_file_content` returned massive results (e.g., 11,841 matches). These errors would halt the workflow and require user intervention, breaking the goal of autonomous agentic operation.

## Solution Overview

We implemented a **multi-layered defense system** that prevents context overflow while maintaining tool effectiveness and enabling autonomous recovery from errors.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Smart Tool Result Truncation (`packages/core/src/utils/result-truncation.ts`)

**Purpose:** Prevent massive tool results from overwhelming the context window while preserving useful information.

**Key Features:**
- **Tool-specific strategies:** Different truncation approaches for different tools
- **Intelligent summarization:** Keeps first N and last N results, summarizes the middle
- **Informative metadata:** Tells the model what was omitted and how to get more details

**Strategies:**
- `search_file_content`: Keeps first 30 and last 30 file sections (max 20,000 chars)
- `read_many_files`: Keeps first 10 and last 10 files (max 30,000 chars)
- `glob`: Generic truncation (max 10,000 chars)
- `run_shell_command`: Generic truncation (max 15,000 chars)

**Example Output:**
```
Found 2553 matches for pattern "debug" in packages/**/*.*

[First 30 files shown...]

... [TRUNCATED FOR CONTEXT MANAGEMENT] ...

Omitted 2493 files with 2400 matches:
  - file1.ts
  - file2.ts
  ... and 2491 more files

[Total: 2553 matches across 2523 files]
[Original size: 289,768 chars (~72,442 tokens)]
[Showing first 30 and last 30 files for context]
[Use more specific patterns or read_file for omitted files]

... [CONTINUING WITH LAST MATCHES] ...

[Last 30 files shown...]
```

### 2. Adaptive History Compression (`packages/core/src/utils/context-recovery.ts`)

**Purpose:** Provide progressive compression strategies when standard compression fails.

**6 Progressive Strategies:**
1. **Compress tool results only** - Summarize large tool outputs
2. **+ Drop intermediate messages** - Remove redundant assistant messages
3. **+ Keep 80% of history** - Sliding window with 80% retention
4. **+ Keep 60% of history** - More aggressive sliding window
5. **+ Keep 40% of history** - Even more aggressive
6. **+ Keep 20% of history** - Most aggressive (last resort)

**Key Functions:**
- `compressToolResults()`: Summarizes function responses
- `dropIntermediateAssistantMessages()`: Removes redundant model messages
- `applySlidingWindow()`: Keeps recent history, drops old
- `applyAdaptiveCompression()`: Combines all strategies

### 3. Self-Healing Error Recovery (`packages/core/src/core/client.ts`)

**Purpose:** Automatically recover from context overflow without user intervention.

**Implementation:**
- Added `tryAdaptiveRecovery()` method that:
  1. Detects when standard compression fails
  2. Tries each of the 6 compression strategies progressively
  3. Logs progress to console for debugging
  4. Returns success/failure status

**Integration:**
- Modified `ensureRequestWithinBudget()` to call recovery before throwing
- Recovery attempts are logged with `[Context Recovery]` prefix
- Only throws error if all 6 strategies fail

**Example Console Output:**
```
[Context Management] Standard compression failed, attempting self-healing recovery...
[Context Recovery] Trying strategy 1/6...
[Context Recovery] Compression ratio: 85.3% (150 -> 128 messages)
[Context Recovery] Strategy 1 insufficient (45000 > 40000 tokens)
[Context Recovery] Trying strategy 2/6...
[Context Recovery] Compression ratio: 72.1% (150 -> 108 messages)
[Context Recovery] ‚úì Recovery successful with strategy 2
```

### 4. Proactive Tool Validation (`packages/core/src/utils/tool-validation.ts`)

**Purpose:** Warn about potentially problematic tool calls BEFORE execution.

**Validation Rules:**
- **search_file_content:**
  - Warns if pattern is too vague (e.g., "debug", "test") without file filter
  - Warns if pattern matches everything (e.g., ".*")
  - Suggests adding `include` filters or more specific patterns

- **read_many_files:**
  - Warns if reading all files recursively without filters
  - Warns if reading more than 50 paths
  - Suggests breaking into smaller operations

- **glob:**
  - Warns if pattern will match everything (e.g., "**/*")
  - Suggests more specific patterns

**Example Warning:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Pattern "debug" may return thousands of results without a file filter.
   üí° Consider adding an 'include' filter (e.g., '**/*.ts', 'src/**/*.js') 
      or using a more specific regex pattern.
```

**Integration:**
- Added to `coreToolScheduler.ts` in `buildInvocation()` flow
- Warnings logged to console with `[Tool Validation]` prefix
- Does not block execution, just warns

### 5. Integration Points

**Modified Files:**
1. `packages/core/src/tools/ripGrep.ts`
   - Added truncation to search results
   - Displays truncation summary in returnDisplay

2. `packages/core/src/tools/read-many-files.ts`
   - Added truncation to concatenated file content
   - Handles both text and binary content appropriately

3. `packages/core/src/core/client.ts`
   - Added adaptive recovery to `ensureRequestWithinBudget()`
   - Imported context-recovery utilities

4. `packages/core/src/core/coreToolScheduler.ts`
   - Added proactive validation before tool execution
   - Logs warnings for potentially large results

## Benefits

### 1. **Autonomous Operation**
- No more workflow-stopping errors
- Self-healing recovery happens automatically
- User intervention only needed if all strategies fail

### 2. **Maintained Effectiveness**
- Tools still return useful information
- Truncation is intelligent, not blunt
- Model gets clear guidance on what was omitted

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Proactive warnings help users write better queries
- Clear console logging for debugging
- Informative error messages when recovery fails

### 4. **Scalability**
- Can handle massive search results (tested with 11,841 matches)
- Progressive strategies adapt to severity
- Configurable thresholds for different tools

## Testing

**Build Status:** ‚úÖ Successful
```bash
npm run build
# All packages built successfully
```

**Test Status:** ‚úÖ Mostly passing (6 failures unrelated to changes)
```bash
npm run test
# 2615 passed | 6 failed (unrelated to context management)
```

**Scenario Testing:**
- Tested with the exact failing scenario from error log
- Pattern "debug" in packages/**/*.* (2553 matches)
- Pattern with EventEmitter (11,841 matches)
- Both now handled gracefully with truncation

## Configuration

All thresholds are configurable in the respective files:

**result-truncation.ts:**
```typescript
export const TRUNCATION_STRATEGIES: Record<string, TruncationStrategy> = {
  search_file_content: { maxChars: 20000, ... },
  read_many_files: { maxChars: 30000, ... },
  // ... customize as needed
};
```

**context-recovery.ts:**
```typescript
export const COMPRESSION_STRATEGIES: CompressionOptions[] = [
  { preserveFraction: 1.0, compressToolResults: true, ... },
  // ... 6 strategies total
];
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for even better context management:

1. **Streaming Summarization:** Summarize results on-the-fly during tool execution
2. **RAG-style Storage:** Store full results externally, keep summaries in context
3. **User Preferences:** Allow users to configure truncation thresholds
4. **Debug Console Integration:** Show truncation/recovery events in debug console
5. **Metrics:** Track compression ratios and recovery success rates

## Conclusion

This solution provides a robust, multi-layered approach to context management that:
- ‚úÖ Prevents context overflow errors
- ‚úÖ Maintains tool effectiveness
- ‚úÖ Enables autonomous recovery
- ‚úÖ Provides helpful guidance to users
- ‚úÖ Scales to handle massive results

The system is production-ready and has been tested with the exact scenarios that previously caused failures.
