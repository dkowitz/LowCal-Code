### Main Sections in the File
| Section | What It Contains |
|---------|------------------|
| **Header** | Title “Qwen Code Conversation Export” with export date & session ID. |
| **User Commands** | A series of user prompts (`/auth`, `/model`, `/logging enable`) that configure the session (LM Studio credentials, approval mode, logging). |
| **Research Requests** | Two major research tasks: <br>1️⃣ Detailed report on the **OpenRouter API** – endpoints, parameters, authentication, rate limits, model info, pricing, examples. <br>2️⃣ Follow‑up request for a deeper dive into **Model Information & Filtering** (how to retrieve context length, pricing, etc.). |
| **Assistant’s Workflows** | For each request the assistant: <br>- Executes web searches (`WebSearch`). <br>- Retrieves pages via `WebFetch`. <br>- Summarizes findings. |
| **OpenRouter Report** | • Authentication method (Bearer token). <br>• Endpoints: `/api/v1/models`, `/api/v1/chat/completions`, `/api/v1/completions`. <br>• Parameters for each endpoint (required & optional). <br>• Example request/response payloads in JSON, cURL and Python. <br>• Model‑specific fields: `context_length`, `pricing`, architecture, etc. <br>• Filtering by `category` and other query params. |
| **Model‑Info Deep Dive** | • How to call `GET /api/v1/models` (or a specific model). <br>• Extracting `context_length` & pricing from the JSON response. <br>• Sample Python helper functions (`get_models`, `extract_model_details`). |
| **LM Studio API Request** | After permission change, the assistant searches LM Studio docs and produces a concise report: <br>- OpenAI‑compatible endpoints (`GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, etc.). <br>- Example usage with the OpenAI Python SDK. <br>- **Limitation:** LM Studio does **not** expose context length or pricing via its API; such metadata must be read from the UI or model files. |
| **Final Notes** | Comparison of LM Studio vs. OpenRouter, and guidance on where to find detailed model specs for LM Studio. |

### Takeaway
`apis.md` is essentially a **conversation log** that captures:
- Session configuration steps,
- The assistant’s systematic web‑search + fetch workflow,
- Two comprehensive API reports (OpenRouter & LM Studio),
- Code snippets and curl examples for developers to call those APIs,
- Clarifications on what information each service provides through its endpoints.
