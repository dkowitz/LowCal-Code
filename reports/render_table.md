## User Message

Examine the codebase and provide a detailed explanation of how react and ink render the elements of the conversation, including tables, code blocks, lists, boxes, etc. I want to know why sometimes a table will include truncated lines of text with ... which makes them unable to read the full intended text. Then explain how the /export command translates the cli markdown display into the markdown files it creates. /export doesn't seem to exactly replicate the visuals from the cli and I'm wondering why.

## Assistant Response

**How the UI is built**

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Message flow**
   - The core UI lives in `packages/cli/src/ui`.
   - Every interaction creates a _history item_ (`type: 'user' | 'gemini' | …`) that is stored by `context.ui.addItem`.
   - The main renderer (`App.tsx` → `ConversationDisplay.tsx`) maps those items to React components such as `UserMessage`, `GeminiMessage`, `InfoMessage`, etc.

---

## Assistant Response

2. **Ink rendering**
   - All UI components use Ink primitives – `<Box>` for layout and `<Text>` for styled text.
   - Ink translates the React tree into terminal escape sequences, so the output you see is pure ANSI‑styled text.

---

## Assistant Response

3. **Markdown → Ink** (`InlineMarkdownRenderer.tsx`)

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
export const RenderInline = ({ text }) => {
  // parses markdown (code fences, bold/italic, links, etc.)
  // and returns a tree of <Text> elements with the appropriate colors/styles.
};
```

- Code blocks become `<Box marginX={2}>` + `<Text>` with a background colour.
- Lists are rendered by prefixing each line with “•”, “1.”, “-” etc., again using `<Text>`.
- Boxes (e.g. dialogs) are just nested `<Box borderStyle="round">` wrappers.

---

## Assistant Response

4. **Tables** (`TableRenderer.tsx`)

---

## Assistant Response

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
const columnWidths = headers.map((h, i) => {
  const headerWidth = getPlainTextLength(h);
  const maxRowWidth = Math.max(
    ...rows.map((r) => getPlainTextLength(r[i] || "")),
  );
  return Math.max(headerWidth, maxRowWidth) + 2; // padding
});
```

- `getPlainTextLength` strips markdown and counts visible characters (ignores ANSI codes).
- If the summed width exceeds the terminal (`terminalWidth`) a **scaleFactor** shrinks every column proportionally.

---

## Assistant Response

**Truncation logic**

---

## Assistant Response

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
if (displayWidth > contentWidth) {
  // < 4 chars → simple slice
  // otherwise binary‑search the longest prefix whose plain‑text length fits,
  // then append "..."
}
```

- The binary search stops when `candidateWidth <= contentWidth - 3`.
- Because truncation happens **after** markdown is rendered, any inline formatting (e.g. backticks, links) is lost in the truncated part – you only see the leading characters followed by “…”.

---

## Assistant Response

This explains why a table cell may appear as:

---

## Assistant Response

---

## Assistant Response

```
   │ long tex… │
```

---

## Assistant Response

The original markdown string still contains the full text; it’s just not displayed because the renderer had to fit the whole table into the current terminal width.

---

## Assistant Response

**How `/export` works**

---

## Assistant Response

File: `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/exportCommand.ts`

---

## Assistant Response

```ts
action: async (context, args) => {
  const historyItems = context.ui.loadHistory(); // raw items stored by UI
  let fileName = args.trim() ? sanitize(args) : "conversation.md";

  let markdownContent = `# Conversation Export\n\n`;
  markdownContent += `Exported on: ${new Date().toISOString()}\n\n`;

  for (const item of historyItems) {
    switch (item.type) {
      case "user":
        markdownContent += `## User\n\n${item.text}\n\n---\n\n`;
        break;
      case "gemini":
      case "gemini_content":
        markdownContent += `## Assistant\n\n${item.text}\n\n---\n\n`;
        break;
      case "info":
        markdownContent += `> ${item.text}\n\n`;
        break;
      case "error":
        markdownContent += `**Error:** ${item.text}\n\n`;
        break;
    }
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(fileName, markdownContent);
  context.ui.addItem(
    { type: "info", text: `Conversation exported to ${fileName}` },
    Date.now(),
  );
};
```

---

## Assistant Response

- **What gets written** – The command iterates over the _raw_ `item.text` strings that were originally fed into the UI. It does **not** run them through any Ink renderer; it simply concatenates them as plain markdown.

---

## Assistant Response

- **Why visual details differ**
  - **Tables:** In the UI a table is rendered by `TableRenderer`, which may have truncated cells to fit the terminal. The _original_ markdown string stored in `item.text` still contains the full cell content, but because the export command never invokes `TableRenderer`, it writes the raw markdown (e.g. `| long text that exceeds width |`). When you open the exported file in a normal editor you’ll see the full text, but if you view it with a terminal‑only renderer that applies the same truncation logic you’ll get the same “…” effect.
  - **Boxes / borders:** Ink’s `<Box borderStyle="round">` and similar decorations are purely visual – they are not part of the markdown payload. Consequently the exported file contains only the inner text (e.g., a dialog’s message) without the surrounding ASCII/Unicode box characters.
  - **Code blocks & lists:** These are preserved because they exist as markdown syntax (`\`\`\``, `- item`). The export command copies them verbatim, so they appear correctly in any markdown viewer.

---

## Assistant Response

- **Current limitation** – The command cannot access the _rendered_ layout (column widths, truncated strings) because that information lives only inside the Ink components at render time. Therefore the exported markdown may look different from what you saw on screen, especially for tables that were forced to shrink.

### TL;DR

## Assistant Response

| Feature                              | Rendered in terminal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Exported markdown |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Plain text / code blocks / lists** | Ink `<Text>` (styled) → same markdown is written out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Tables**                           | `TableRenderer` computes column widths, scales, and _truncates_ cells with “…”. Export writes the original markdown; no scaling/truncation occurs, so you either see the full cell content or, if you view the file with a terminal‑only table renderer, you’ll get the same truncation. |
| **Boxes / borders**                  | Ink `<Box borderStyle>` – visual only. Not stored in markdown → not present in export.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### How to make `/export` match the on‑screen view

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Capture rendered output** – Instead of using `item.text`, ask the UI layer for a _rendered string_ (e.g., call a helper that runs `TableRenderer` with a very wide virtual terminal width).
2. **Disable truncation for export** – Pass a large `terminalWidth` to `TableRenderer` (or expose a “no‑truncate” mode) so the full markdown is emitted.
3. **Add box decorations manually** – If you want the exported file to contain the same ASCII borders, generate them in the export routine (e.g., reuse the border strings from `TableRenderer`).

---

## Assistant Response

Implementing any of those steps would bring the exported `.md` files much closer to what you see inside the Qwen Code CLI.

### How to verify a project’s Ink usage

1. Look at its `package.json` → dependencies include `"ink"` (or an Ink‑based package).
2. Search the source for imports like `import { Box, Text } from 'ink'`.
3. Examine UI components: they will return JSX using `<Box>` / `<Text>` and often call `render(<App />)` from Ink’s entry point.

## User Message

Ok, now I want to revisit the problem of tables in the cli truncating text. It happens almost all the time, and makes the table almost useless as its intended information is unavailble to fully read. I want you to formulate a way to modify the rendering engine to fix this and implement true multi-line/wrap for tables. Present a plan of how to do this.

## Assistant Response

**Goal**  
Replace the current single‑line truncation in `packages/cli/src/ui/utils/TableRenderer.tsx` with true multi‑line word‑wrap so every cell can display its full content (including markdown) without being cut off.

---

---

## Assistant Response

### 1️⃣ Understand the existing implementation

- **Column width calculation** – uses `getPlainTextLength` on raw header / cell strings, adds padding, then scales if total width > terminal width.
- **Truncation** – if a cell’s plain‑text length exceeds its allotted width, a binary search finds the longest prefix that fits and appends `"…"`.
- **Rendering** – each row is rendered as one `<Text>` line with vertical borders (`│`).

## Assistant Response

### 2️⃣ Add a reusable wrap utility

Create `wrapCell(content: string, maxWidth: number): string[]` that:

1. Calls `getPlainTextLength` on the whole string to know its display width.
2. Splits the content into words (respecting whitespace).
   - If a single word’s length > `maxWidth`, break it character‑wise.
3. Builds lines until adding another word would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Returns an array of wrapped strings **preserving the original markdown** (the wrapper does not modify markup; each line will later be fed to `<RenderInline>` which re‑parses markdown).

---

## Assistant Response

### 3️⃣ Adjust column width logic

- Keep the initial width calculation as a _maximum_ based on the longest unwrapped cell, then apply the existing scaling factor.
- After scaling we know `contentWidth` for each column.
- For every cell, call `wrapCell(cellContent, contentWidth - 2)` (subtract padding) to get its wrapped lines.

### 4️⃣ Render rows with variable height

1. For a given row, obtain the wrapped line arrays of all cells.
2. Determine `rowHeight = max(wrappedLines[i].length for each cell i)`.
3. Loop `lineIdx` from 0 to `rowHeight‑1` and render a `<Text>` line:
   - For each column:  
     _If the cell has a line at `lineIdx`, render it via `<RenderInline>`; otherwise render an empty string._
   - Pad each rendered line to exactly `contentWidth` using spaces (`' '.repeat(padding)`).
4. Surround each line with vertical borders (`│`) just like the current single‑line version.
5. The top, middle, and bottom border rendering stays unchanged.

## Assistant Response

### 5️⃣ Header handling

- Run headers through the same wrap utility (they’ll normally stay one line).
- Render header rows using the multi‑line loop; this keeps the code path uniform.

---

## Assistant Response

### 6️⃣ Update styling & edge cases

- Preserve existing bold/color for headers (`<Text bold color={Colors.AccentCyan}>`).
- Ensure that markdown inside wrapped lines (e.g., backticks, links) is still rendered correctly because each line is passed through `<RenderInline>` again.
- If a cell contains newline characters already, treat them as explicit line breaks before wrapping.

| Test case                          | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long plain text                    | Cell longer than terminal width → expect wrapped lines, no `"…"`.             |
| Markdown with backticks            | Verify formatting is retained on each wrapped line.                           |
| Word longer than column width      | Ensure the word is split correctly (character‑wise).                          |
| Mixed short/long cells in same row | Row height equals longest cell; shorter cells padded correctly.               |
| Terminal resize simulation         | Change `terminalWidth` prop and assert columns re‑scale and wrap accordingly. |

---

## Assistant Response

Run the project’s test suite (`npm run test --workspaces`) to confirm no regressions.

## Assistant Response

### 8️⃣ Lint / Type‑check

- After code changes, run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.
- Ensure all new functions are typed (e.g., `wrapCell(content: string, maxWidth: number): string[]`).

---

## Assistant Response

### 9️⃣ Documentation

- Update the comment block at the top of `TableRenderer.tsx` to describe the new wrapping behavior.
- Optionally add a note in the CLI README about how tables now wrap instead of truncating.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance** – wrapping every cell on each render could be costly for huge tables.                                     | UI lag on very large outputs.     | Use simple loops, memoize `getPlainTextLength` results per render cycle; only wrap once per cell per render.                                                                                                               |
| **Markdown breakage** – splitting inside a markdown token (e.g., `[link](url)`) might produce malformed markup on a line. | Visual glitches in rendered text. | Because each wrapped line is re‑parsed by `<RenderInline>`, the markup will be interpreted correctly even if split; ensure we don’t cut off escape sequences (`\x1b[`), which are stripped by `getPlainTextLength` anyway. |
| **Terminal resize** – column widths may become stale after a resize event.                                                | Misaligned tables.                | The component already recomputes on each render (receives `terminalWidth` prop); our logic follows the same pattern, so resizing will trigger re‑wrap automatically.                                                       |
| **Breaking existing tests**                                                                                               | CI failures.                      | Add/adjust tests to reflect new behavior; run full test suite before committing.                                                                                                                                           |
