1. **Metadata**
   * Export date – 10 Feb 2025  
   * Session ID – `80a0cffc-10f8-4aa3-b1e3-9cb181818868`
   * LM‑Studio credentials were set, model switched to `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct-480b-distill-v2`, and logging was enabled.



---

## Assistant Response

2. **User requests**
   * First request: research the OpenRouter API – list all endpoints, parameters, descriptions, examples, and model‑info (context length, pricing, etc.).
   * Follow‑up request: do the same for the LM Studio local API.

## Assistant Response

3. **Assistant actions & results**
   * Performed web searches and fetches to gather documentation from OpenRouter (`/overview`, `/list-available-models`, `/chat-completion`, `/completion`, authentication, rate limits, etc.).
   * Compiled a detailed report on OpenRouter:
     - Authentication method (Bearer token, optional headers).
     - Endpoints: `GET /api/v1/models`, `POST /api/v1/chat/completions`, `POST /api/v1/completions`.
     - Parameters for each endpoint (required & optional) with ranges.
     - Example code snippets in Python and cURL.
     - Model information fields (context length, pricing breakdown, architecture, defaults).
     - Filtering models by category via the `category` query param.
     - Usage limits/quotas and key features.



---

## Assistant Response

   * Follow‑up user asked for deeper details on “Model Information and Filtering” – provided a Python helper that calls `GET /api/v1/models`, extracts `context_length`, `pricing`, etc., shows how to filter by category, and even how to request a single model (`/models/<model-id>`).

4. **LM Studio API research**
   * After permission was granted, fetched LM Studio’s OpenAI‑compatible endpoint docs.
   * Summarized the LM Studio local API:
     - Base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:1234/v1`).
     - Endpoints: `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/completions`, `POST /v1/embeddings`.
     - Example usage with the OpenAI Python SDK.
   * Noted key limitation: LM Studio’s API does **not** expose detailed model metadata such as context length or pricing; that info is only available via the UI or directly from model files.



---

## Assistant Response

5. **Overall**
   * The file captures a full research session, including tool calls, fetched content, and the final reports for both OpenRouter and LM Studio APIs.
