## User Message

Use the web search tool to perform a deep research into the LM Studio api.  We need to know how to obtain the ctx size of loaded models.  Currently we do this for our OpenRouter models, and we display the context windows size in the available models list in the /models command.  Now we need to do that for the LM Studio models.  We currently use the v1/models endpoint to fetch the available models from LM Studio, but this doesn't provide extra details like ctx length.  I think there is a way to do it with the REST api, perhaps with a /v0/ endpoint.  Please do extensive web research and report your results.

## Assistant Response

Based on my research, I've found how to obtain the context window size (ctx length) of LM Studio models. Here's what I discovered:

## LM Studio API Endpoints for Context Window Information

1. **GET /api/v0/models** - Lists all available models with their basic information including `max_context_length`
2. **GET /api/v0/models/{model}** - Retrieves detailed information about a specific model, also including `max_context_length`

## Key Findings:

- The context window size is provided in the response field called `max_context_length`
- This field indicates the maximum number of tokens that can be processed by the model in a single inference call
- For example, a typical response might include: `"max_context_length": 32768`

## Implementation Approach:

For your codebase where you currently fetch models from LM Studio using the v1/models endpoint (which doesn't provide context window information), you'll need to modify your implementation to use one of these new endpoints:
- Either call `GET /api/v0/models` to get all models with their context lengths
- Or for each model, make a separate call to `GET /api/v0/models/{model}`

This will allow you to display the context window size in your `/models` command output, just like you do for OpenRouter models.

## Assistant Response

The API is already designed to provide this information through these endpoints, so no additional configuration or setup should be needed beyond making the appropriate HTTP requests.
