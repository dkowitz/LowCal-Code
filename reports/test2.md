## Assistant Response

| Section | What it contains |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Header** | Export date & session ID. |
| **User messages** | Commands you issued (`/auth`, `/model`, `/logging enable`) and later requests for research reports. |
| **Assistant actions** | Descriptions of the steps the assistant took (e.g., “search web”, “fetch URL”). |
| **Tool results** | Raw outputs from `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` calls – URLs queried, status messages, and fetched page content. |
| **Generated reports** | Two full‑length reports: <br>1️⃣ **OpenRouter API** – authentication, endpoints (`/models`, `/chat/completions`, `/completions`), parameters, response formats, example code (cURL & Python) and usage limits.<br>2️⃣ **LM Studio local API** – OpenAI‑compatible endpoints (`GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, etc.), sample client usage, and a note that detailed model metadata (context length, pricing) isn’t exposed via the API. |
| **Follow‑up dialogue** | Your request for more detail on “Model Information & Filtering” (OpenRouter) and then the new request to do the same for LM Studio, plus the assistant’s attempts to fetch that information. |
