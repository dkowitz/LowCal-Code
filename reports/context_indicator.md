## User Message

I need a full report on how the '(xxx% context left)' status indicator works.  Do a deep dive into the codebase to find out:  Where does it get it's baseline for the total conext window size from?  Does it use the same base figure as our other context management systems?  Does it take it per model when a model is loaded from OpenRouter or LM Studio (the max context size from the OpenRouter api or the configured context size we get from LM Studio when loading models with /model)?  I ask because we really need to drill down on context window, token, and history management and there seems to be discrepencies - sometimes the indicator will say '95% context left', but we'll still get an error that an input is too large for the context window or that the current history can't be compressed to fit in the window.

## Assistant Response

**How it works:**
- Uses `tokenLimit(model)` from '@qwen-code/qwen-code-core'
- Calculates `(promptTokenCount / tokenLimit(model))` to get usage percentage
- Displays `(1 - percentage) * 100` as "context left"

### 2. **Baseline Context Window Size Calculation**

---

## Assistant Response

**Location:** `/packages/core/src/core/tokenLimits.ts`

---

## Assistant Response

**Key findings:**
- Uses a **hardcoded static mapping** of model names to context limits
- **NO dynamic fetching** from OpenRouter or LM Studio APIs
- **Default fallback:** `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT = 131_072` (128K tokens)

---

## Assistant Response

**Static limit patterns include:**

---

## Assistant Response

```typescript
const LIMITS = {
  '32k': 32_768,
  '64k': 65_536,
  '128k': 131_072,
  '200k': 200_000, // Vendor-declared decimal (OpenAI/Anthropic)
  '256k': 262_144,
  '512k': 524_288,
  '1m': 1_048_576,
  '2m': 2_097_152,
  '10m': 10_485_760,
};
```

## Assistant Response

**Model normalization logic:**
- Strips provider prefixes, pipes/colons, date/version suffixes
- Removes quantization suffixes (e.g., `-4bit`, `-bf16`)
- **Critical issue:** May not handle all external model naming conventions

---

## Assistant Response

### 3. **Integration with OpenRouter/LM Studio**

---

## Assistant Response

**OpenRouter Integration:**
- Location: `/packages/core/src/core/openaiContentGenerator/provider/openrouter.ts`
- **NO dynamic context limit fetching**
- Only adds headers for attribution (`HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`)

---

## Assistant Response

**LM Studio Integration:**  
- Location: `/packages/core/src/core/openaiContentGenerator/provider/lmstudio.ts`
- **NO dynamic context limit detection**
- Has special timeout handling (15 minutes minimum)
- Attempts model unloading but no API-based limit discovery

---

## Assistant Response

### 4. **Critical Discrepancies Identified**

---

## Assistant Response

#### **Issue 1: Static vs Dynamic Context Limits**
- **Indicator shows:** Based on hardcoded `tokenLimit(model)`
- **Actual limits:** May differ from what OpenRouter/LM Studio report
- **Impact:** Indicator can show "95% context left" while actual API rejects for exceeding real limit

---

## Assistant Response

#### **Issue 2: Model Naming Convention Mismatches**
- External models may have naming patterns not covered by normalization
- Example: `openrouter/qwen/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` might not match any pattern
- Falls back to default 128K instead of actual model limit

---

## Assistant Response

#### **Issue 3: No API-Based Context Discovery**
- OpenRouter and LM Studio APIs could provide accurate context limits
- This information is completely ignored by the current implementation
- Missing opportunity for dynamic, accurate context management

---

## Assistant Response

### 5. **Context Management Architecture**

---

## Assistant Response

**Token Budget Manager:** `/packages/core/src/core/tokenBudgetManager.ts`
- Uses `getEffectiveContextLimit()` which checks:
  1. Custom overrides via `setModelContextLimit()`
  2. Falls back to `tokenLimit(model)` from static mapping

---

## Assistant Response

**Compression System:**
- Has sophisticated compression when approaching limits
- But operates on potentially incorrect baseline limits
- Can fail if actual context limit is different than calculated

---

## Assistant Response

## Root Cause Analysis

---

## Assistant Response

The core issue is that the system uses **static, hardcoded model mappings** instead of:

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Dynamic API calls** to OpenRouter/LM Studio for accurate context limits
2. **Fallback mechanisms** when model names don't match patterns
3. **Real-time validation** against actual provider-reported limits

---

## Assistant Response

## Recommendations

---

## Assistant Response

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Add dynamic context limit fetching** from OpenRouter/LM Studio APIs
2. **Implement fallback logic** for unmapped model names  
3. **Add API-based validation** to detect when static limits are incorrect

---

## Assistant Response

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Context limit caching** with periodic refresh
2. **Provider-specific metadata** handling (OpenRouter, LM Studio)
3. **User-configurable overrides** for custom models
4. **Real-time error correlation** between indicator and actual API failures

---

## Assistant Response

## Verification Steps

---

## Assistant Response

To reproduce the discrepancies you mentioned:

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Check model normalization:** Look at what normalized model name is being used vs actual provider name
2. **Verify static mapping:** Confirm if your model exists in the `LIMITS` object in `tokenLimits.ts`
3. **Test with known limits:** Use models with documented context sizes (e.g., GPT-4 128K) to see if indicator matches reality
4. **Monitor API errors:** Track when "input too large" errors occur vs what percentage indicator shows

---

## Assistant Response

The disconnect between the "(xxx% context left)" indicator and actual context window behavior is likely due to these static hardcoded limits not matching the real-world context sizes reported by external providers like OpenRouter and LM Studio.
