LowCal is a powerful command-line AI workflow tool adapted from Qwen Code, specifically optimized for local use with LM Studio and cloud models with OpenRouter. It enhances your development workflow with advanced code understanding, automated tasks, and intelligent assistance.

#### Session Commands

- **`/compress`** - Compress conversation history to continue within token limits
- **`/clear`** - Clear all conversation history and start fresh
- **`/stats`** - Check current token usage and limits

> 📝 **Note**: Session token limit applies to a single conversation, not cumulative API calls.
