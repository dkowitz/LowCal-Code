      "Ok, we want to re-write how our /model command handles LM Studio models to display available models for selection.  In the LM Studio application, the user can configure the context length of each model and save that setting, which is recalled and applied when the model is loaded.  I've found that these settings are saved in json files in folders in /home/atmandk/.lmstudio/.internal/user-concrete-model-default-config/.  Currently, we use the REST api to fetch the available models and their MAX ctx size.  What we want is to fetch their CONFIGURED ctx size, because that is what we actually have to work with when the model is loaded.  Only models that have been configured manually have configuration files, and we only want to see these models, because unconfigured models have a default ctx length of 4k, which is useless for our application.  SO - we want to re-write our /model command for LM Studio to traverse the folders, find the json configuration files, and use those to list available models, along with their configured context size, rather than use the REST api at all.  Let me know if you understand the task."
