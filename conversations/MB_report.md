## User Message

When we made the changes to the context status indicator in @context_indicator.md we were supposed to have removed the 'xxx MB' part of the footer, but it's still there.  Here is what it looks like:

openai/gpt-5-mini (400,000/400,000 tokens available) (100% context left)| 418.4 MB

Let's remove it.
