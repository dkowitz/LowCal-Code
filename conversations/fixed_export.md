Thanks — I fixed that behavior.

What I changed (concise)
- Parsing: when no option is provided the command now treats the input as a filename (if present) and only treats the first token as an option when it is exactly "compact" or "report".
- Full export: when no option is selected the command now uses the full history (filteredHistory = [...history]) instead of using the compact filter.
- Tool content: added handling for tool-related history item shapes (tool_group, tool, tool_call, tool_call_request, tool_stats) and normalizes them into a tools array so tool calls + results are included in the export.

How that addresses the two problems
- Optional filename: supplying "/export removed_MB.md" will now be treated as a filename, not an invalid option.
- Full content: "/export" (no args) now exports the full conversation including info, error and tool entries (not limited to user + assistant).

Next steps
- I can run the exportCommand unit tests (vitest) and/or run the repository preflight/build to verify nothing else regressed. Do you want me to:
  1) Run only the exportCommand unit tests now? (recommended quick check) or
  2) Run the full test/preflight (slower — build + lint + tests)?

Also note: if you are running an already-built binary (bundle/gemini.js) you may need to rebuild/restart the CLI for the change to take effect. Which do you prefer me to run?
