How feasible would it be to add a simple inline text file viewer in the chat, triggered with a command like '/view file.md'.  I see it as a fixed height vertically scrolling box with the file contents inside that can be scrolled through, then when an exit key is pressed, it disappears.

**Feasibility Assessment – Inline File Viewer (`/view <path>`)**

---

## Assistant Response

| Aspect | Evaluation | Comments |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **UI Layer** | ✅ Easy to implement in the web‑client (React/HTML). A fixed‑height `<div>` with `overflow‑y: auto` provides the scrolling box. |
| **Command Hook** | ✅ Add a new slash‑command handler (`/view`) that parses the argument, sends a request to the backend to read the file, and injects the returned text into the viewer component. |
| **Backend API** | ✅ Already have a `read_file`‑style endpoint (used by the CLI). Expose a lightweight HTTP route (e.g., `GET /api/file?path=...`) that returns the file content (plain text). Must enforce path sanitisation (confine to the project root) and size limits (e.g., ≤ 100 KB) to avoid abuse. |
| **Security** | ⚠️ Needs validation: <br>• Prevent directory‑traversal (`../`). <br>• Restrict to files inside the workspace. <br>• Optionally whitelist extensions (`.md`, `.txt`, `.json`, etc.). |
| **Performance** | ✅ Reading a single text file is trivial; latency will be well under a second for typical files. |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ Show a friendly message inside the viewer if the file cannot be read (missing, too large, disallowed type). |
| **Exit Mechanism** | ✅ Bind a key (e.g., `Esc` or a close button) that removes the viewer component from the DOM. |
| **Cross‑Platform** | ✅ Works on Linux, macOS, Windows as long as the client runs in a browser or Electron‑style UI |
| **Dependencies** | ✅ No new third‑party libraries required; existing React/TS stack suffices. |
| **Testing** | ✅ Add unit tests for the backend route (path validation, size limits) and integration tests for the UI component (open/close, scroll behavior). |

### Rough Implementation Steps

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Backend**  
   - Add `/api/file` route in `packages/core (or wherever the server lives).  
   - Validate `path` against the project root, enforce allowed extensions, and cap size.  
   - Return `{content: string}` JSON.

---

## Assistant Response

2. **Frontend**  
   - Extend the slash‑command registry with `/view`.  
   - On execution, call the new, store the result in component state.  
   - Render `<div className="file-viewer">` with CSS: `height: 300px; overflow-y: auto; background:#fafafa; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:0.5rem;`.  
   - Add a close button or `Esc` to unmount the component.

3. **Styling**  
   - Use existing theme variables for colors and fonts to keep visual consistency.

## Assistant Response

4. **Testing**  
   - Backend: Jest tests for path sanitisation and size limit  
   Frontend: React Testing Library tests for opening, rendering content, scrolling, and closing.

### Risks / Mitigations

---

## Assistant Response

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Path traversal / reading sensitive files | Strictly resolve the requested path relative to the workspace root and reject any that escape it. |
| Large files causing UI freeze | Enforce a size limit (e.g., 100 KB) and show “File too large” message. |
| Binary files displayed as garbled text | Whitelist only text‑based extensions; otherwise show “Unsupported file type”. |
| Performance impact on heavily concurrent users | The endpoint is read‑only and cheap; caching is optional not required. |

### Verdict

---

## Assistant Response

**Highly feasible** – the feature requires only a modest amount of backend validation and a small UI component. With proper security checks, it can be added in a single sprint (≈ 1–2 days of development and testing).
