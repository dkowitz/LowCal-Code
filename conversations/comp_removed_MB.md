## User Message

When we made the changes to the context status indicator in @context_indicator.md we were supposed to have removed the 'xxx MB' part of the footer, but it's still there.  Here is what it looks like:

openai/gpt-5-mini (400,000/400,000 tokens available) (100% context left)| 418.4 MB

Let's remove it.

## Assistant Response

Done â€” I removed the MemoryUsageDisplay (the "xxx MB" footer value) from the Footer component.

---

## Assistant Response

What I changed
- packages/cli/src/ui/components/Footer.tsx
  - Removed the MemoryUsageDisplay import and the JSX that rendered it.

---

## Assistant Response

Next steps (optional)
- If you want the memory display available elsewhere (e.g., a debug command or separate status pane), I can add a toggleable component or move MemoryUsageDisplay to a different place.
- Run the test suite to update any snapshot tests that expected the MB text (Footer tests may need updates).

## Assistant Response

Would you like me to run tests now and fix any failing tests/snapshots?
