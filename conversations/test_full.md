## Assistant Response

The `/export report` command is a built‚Äëin slash command defined in **packages/cli/src/ui/commands/exportCommand.ts**.  
When invoked, it:

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Collects the conversation history** from `context.ui.getHistory()`.  
2. **Parses arguments** ‚Äì if the first word is `report`, that option is used; otherwise the whole argument string is treated as a filename.  
3. **Validates the option** (`compact` or `report`).  
4. **Builds a file name**: either from the supplied name (sanitised) or a timestamped default like `report-2025‚Äë10‚Äë16T‚Ä¶md`.  
5. **Chooses an output directory** ‚Äì `./reports` for `report`, otherwise `./conversations`.  
6. **Filters history**:
   * `compact`: only user and assistant messages.  
   * `report`: all leading user messages until the first non‚Äëuser message, plus the final assistant responses after the last non‚Äëassistant message.  
   * default: full history.  
7. **Formats the selected items into Markdown**, adding headers for users, assistants, info/errors, and tool executions.  
8. **Writes the file** to the chosen directory and reports success or failure via `context.ui.addItem`.
