## User Message

Summarize @context_indicator.md in a single paragraph.

---

## Assistant Response

The @context_indicator.md document details the implementation of a dynamic context window indicator in the Qwen Code project, replacing hardcoded model limits with real-time values from OpenRouter and LM Studio. The update shifts the UI to display token counts (e.g., "98,000/131,000 tokens") and percentage context remaining, while the core logic now prioritizes provider-supplied context limits via `tokenLimits.ts` and `Config`. Key changes include: (1) updating `ContextUsageDisplay` and the footer to reflect current model limits, (2) fixing model-switching behavior to ensure immediate updates for both providers, (3) removing the "MB" metric in favor of token-based visualization, and (4) addressing test issues related to token tracking and stale limits. The solution ensures the indicator accurately reflects available context based on loaded models, improving usability and alignment with dynamic model configurations.

## User Message

Where are commands stored in the codebase?

---

## Assistant Response

The commands in the Qwen Code project are stored in the **`cli` package** within the `src` directory. Here's the breakdown:

---

## Assistant Response

1. **Entry Point**:  
   The CLI is defined in `packages/cli/src/main.ts` (or similar entry point files), which bootstraps the application and handles command-line interactions.

---

## Assistant Response

2. **Command Definitions**:  
   Commands (e.g., `/model`, `/auth`) are implemented in the `packages/cli/src/commands` directory. Each command is a separate file (e.g., `model.ts`, `auth.ts`) that defines logic for handling specific CLI interactions.

---

## Assistant Response

3. **UI/UX Logic**:  
   The CLI's UI/UX (e.g., footer, context indicator) is managed in `packages/cli/src/ui` and `packages/cli/src/App.tsx`, which integrate with the core logic.

---

## Assistant Response

4. **Configuration**:
   - The CLI's entry point is specified in `package.json` under `bin`: `"bin": "bundle/gemini.js"`.
   - The `scripts` section in `package.json` includes commands like `start`, `build`, and `test` for the CLI.

---

## Assistant Response

5. **Build System**:  
   The CLI is built using the root `Makefile` and `package.json` scripts (e.g., `npm run start`).

---

## Assistant Response

### Key Files:

- `packages/cli/src/main.ts` (entry point)
- `packages/cli/src/commands/` (command-specific logic)
- `packages/cli/src/ui/` (UI/UX components)
- `package.json` (bin and script definitions)

---

## Assistant Response

This structure aligns with standard CLI workflows, where commands are modularized and centralized in the `cli` package.
