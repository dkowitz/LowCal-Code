# Detailed Guide on Accessing Model Information via OpenRouter API

Based on my research, here's a more detailed explanation of how to use the OpenRouter API to gather specific model information like context length and pricing:

## Getting Complete Model Information

To access all the detailed model information including context length and pricing, you need to call the `GET /api/v1/models` endpoint.

### Example Request:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response Structure with Detailed Information:

When you make this request, each model in the response contains these key fields for context length and pricing information:

**Context Length Information:**
```json
{
  "id": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "name": "GPT-4o",
  "context_length": 128000,
  "top_provider": {
    "context_length": 128000,
    "max_completion_tokens": 16384
  },
  ...
}
```

**Pricing Information:**
```json
{
  "id": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "name": "GPT-4o",
  "pricing": {
    "prompt": "0.0000007",
    "completion": "0.0000007",
    "image": "0",
    "request": "0",
    "web_search": "0",
    "internal_reasoning": "0",
    "input_cache_read": "0",
    "input_cache_write": "0"
  },
  ...
}
```

## Filtering Models by Category

To filter models by specific categories (like programming, roleplay, marketing), use the `category` parameter:

### Example Request:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models?category=programming" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Detailed Python Implementation

Here's a more detailed example of how to access this information programmatically in Python:

```python
import requests
import json

def get_models(api_key, category=None):
    """
    Get all available models or filter by category
    
    Args:
        api_key (str): Your OpenRouter API key
        category (str, optional): Filter models by category
        
    Returns:
        list: List of model dictionaries with detailed information
    """
    url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models"
    
    # Add query parameters if category is specified
    params = {}
    if category:
        params['category'] = category
    
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        return None

def extract_model_details(models_data):
    """
    Extract specific information like context length and pricing from models data
    
    Args:
        models_data (dict): Response from get_models function
        
    Returns:
        list: List of dictionaries with key model details
    """
    if not models_data or 'data' not in models_data:
        return []
    
    detailed_info = []
    
    for model in models_data['data']:
        info = {
            'id': model.get('id'),
            'name': model.get('name'),
            'context_length': model.get('context_length') or 
                             (model.get('top_provider', {}).get('context_length') if model.get('top_provider') else None),
            'pricing': model.get('pricing', {}),
            'description': model.get('description')
        }
        
        detailed_info.append(info)
    
    return detailed_info

# Usage example
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
models_data = get_models(api_key, category="programming")
if models_data:
    model_details = extract_model_details(models_data)
    
    # Print specific information for each model
    for model in model_details:
        print(f"Model: {model['name']} ({model['id']})")
        print(f"Context Length: {model['context_length']} tokens")
        print(f"Pricing (prompt): ${model['pricing'].get('prompt', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"Pricing (completion): ${model['pricing'].get('completion', 'N/A')}")
        print("---")
```

## Accessing Specific Model Information

If you want to get information about a specific model, you can also make individual requests for that model:

### Example Request for Specific Model:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models/openai/gpt-4o" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Using the Information in Your Application

The information you can gather includes:

1. **Context Length**: This tells you how many tokens a model can handle (e.g., 128000 for GPT-4o)
2. **Pricing Details**: You get pricing per prompt token, completion token, and other costs
3. **Model Architecture**: Input/output modalities, tokenizer type, etc.
4. **Supported Parameters**: What parameters each model supports

This information is crucial when choosing which models to use for different tasks based on your requirements (like context length needed or budget constraints).

## Filtering by Multiple Criteria

You can also combine filtering options:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models?category=programming&use_rss=true" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

# Complete Report on LM Studio Local API

Based on my research, here's a comprehensive report about the LM Studio local API:

## Overview

LM Studio provides an OpenAI-compatible API that allows you to interact with locally hosted language models. The API is accessible through standard HTTP endpoints and can be used with existing OpenAI client libraries.

## API Endpoints

### 1. List Models (`GET /v1/models`)

**Purpose**: Retrieve information about currently loaded models in LM Studio.

**Endpoint**: `GET http://localhost:1234/v1/models`

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "model-identifier",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1677610602,
      "owned_by": "organization-owner"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Usage (Python)**:
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1"
)

# List models
models = client.models.list()
print(models)
```

### 2. Chat Completions (`POST /v1/chat/completions`)

**Purpose**: Generate chat-style responses from language models.

**Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`

**Request Parameters**:
- `model`: The model ID to use
- `messages`: Array of message objects with "role" and "content"
- Additional parameters like temperature, max_tokens, etc. (same as OpenAI)

**Example Usage (Python)**:
```python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="model-identifier",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

### 3. Completions (`POST /v1/completions`)

**Purpose**: Generate text completions from language models (legacy endpoint).

**Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:1234/v1/completions`

**Request Parameters**:
- `model`: The model ID to use
- `prompt`: The text prompt to complete

### 4. Embeddings (`POST /v1/embeddings`)

**Purpose**: Generate embeddings for text.

**Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings`

## Model Information Limitations

While LM Studio provides OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, there are important limitations regarding detailed model information:

### Context Length and Pricing Information
The LM Studio API does not expose context length or pricing details through its standard API endpoints. This information is typically:
- Available in the model files themselves
- Found in LM Studio's UI when viewing individual models
- Accessible through LM Studio's internal model management system

### Model Metadata Through API
The `/v1/models` endpoint only returns basic model identifiers and ownership information, not detailed specifications like context window size or pricing.

## Usage with OpenAI Libraries

LM Studio is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI Python SDK. You can use it directly:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1"
)

# List models
models = client.models.list()

# Chat completion
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="model-identifier",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
)
```

## Key Differences from OpenRouter

Unlike OpenRouter, LM Studio's API:
1. Does not provide detailed pricing information through its endpoints
2. Does not expose context length limits via the API
3. Is designed for local model hosting rather than a marketplace of models
4. Provides basic model listing but lacks comprehensive metadata in API responses

## Accessing Detailed Model Information

To get complete model details like context length and specifications:
1. Check LM Studio's UI directly where you can view detailed information about each loaded model
2. Examine the model files themselves for technical specifications
3. Refer to documentation provided with specific models or LM Studio's general documentation

This approach means that while you can interact with models through the API, getting comprehensive details like context length and pricing requires looking at LM Studio's interface rather than its API endpoints.
